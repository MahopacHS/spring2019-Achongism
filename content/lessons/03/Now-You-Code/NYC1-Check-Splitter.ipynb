It doesnt work because the code cant see two as a number.\n2. What type of error is this? ValueErrorDo you think it can be handled in code?I think it can be if you make number words instead of numbers readable.\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? it doesnt run i think because one half is not a whole number and it does make sense.\n",
