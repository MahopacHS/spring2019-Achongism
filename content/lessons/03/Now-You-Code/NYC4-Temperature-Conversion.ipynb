Is this an error? because there still are negative temperatures and there is no error\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain. No because all you would have to do is change the equation to  a farenheight-celcius conversion\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?I\n"
